# Active Context ✅ CRITICAL ISSUES FIXED - QR Meter Reading System

## Current Focus
**NEW ISSUES IDENTIFIED** in the QR Meter Reading System. Database schema and stored procedure have been deployed successfully. Core reading save functionality is working, but several additional issues need to be addressed before production deployment.

## Current Task
**PRIORITY 1**: Fix newly identified issues:
1. **Location Data Capture**: Fix empty location_data column in t_tenant_reading_ext
2. **Report SQL Error**: Fix meter-reading-report.php SQL parameter type error
3. **UI Population**: Fix recent readings table not showing data
4. **Dialog Design**: Improve success dialog user experience and data presentation
5. **End-to-End Testing**: Test all scenarios including first-time readings and tenant transitions

## Critical Issues Status ✅

### ✅ Issue 1: Incorrect Previous Reading Calculation - FIXED
- **Problem**: Stored procedure not correctly retrieving previous reading from most recent reading for unit
- **Impact**: Previous readings saved incorrectly, affecting usage calculations
- **Status**: **FIXED** - Updated to use vw_TenantReading with consistent ORDER BY ISNULL(reading_date, convert(date, reading_date_to)) DESC for proper chronological ordering including late encoding scenarios

### ✅ Issue 2: Missing Charge Code Integration - FIXED
- **Problem**: System not creating entries in t_tenant_reading_charges for CUCF and CUCNF charge codes
- **Impact**: Charge codes not linked to readings, breaking billing workflow
- **Status**: **FIXED** - Stored procedure now properly handles charge code integration

### ✅ Issue 3: Invoice Columns Not Set to NULL - FIXED
- **Problem**: Invoice-related columns in t_tenant_reading_charges should be NULL initially
- **Impact**: May cause issues with billing workflow
- **Status**: **FIXED** - Invoice columns now properly initialized as NULL

### ✅ Issue 4: First-Time Reading Scenario - FIXED
- **Problem**: New units with no previous readings not handled properly
- **Impact**: First-time readings could fail or produce incorrect results
- **Status**: **FIXED** - Added proper handling for NULL previous readings

### ✅ Issue 5: Input Validation Enhancement - FIXED
- **Problem**: Current reading validation not strict enough (allowed 0)
- **Impact**: Invalid readings could be saved
- **Status**: **FIXED** - Updated validation to require current reading > 0

## New Issues Status ⚠️

### ❌ Issue 7: Location Data Not Captured - NEEDS FIX
- **Problem**: `location_data` column in `t_tenant_reading_ext` is empty
- **Impact**: Missing GPS/location information for audit trail
- **Status**: **NEEDS FIX**

### ❌ Issue 8: Meter Reading Report SQL Error - NEEDS FIX
- **Problem**: `meter-reading-report.php` returns SQL error: "The number of rows provided for a TOP or FETCH clauses row count parameter must be an integer"
- **Impact**: Report generation fails completely
- **Status**: **NEEDS FIX**

### ❌ Issue 9: Recent Readings UI Not Populated - NEEDS FIX
- **Problem**: Recent readings table in UI is not showing the last reading data
- **Impact**: Users cannot see their recent readings in the interface
- **Status**: **NEEDS FIX**

### ❌ Issue 10: Success Dialog Design Issues - NEEDS FIX
- **Problem**: Success dialog box is not following best design practices for user-friendly data display
- **Impact**: Poor user experience and unclear information presentation
- **Status**: **NEEDS FIX**

### ❌ Issue 11: Electric Meter Replacement Scenario - SOLUTION IDENTIFIED
- **Problem**: When electric meters are replaced, new meter starts at 0, making previous reading = 0
- **Impact**: Usage calculation would be incorrect (current reading - 0 = current reading as usage)
- **Status**: **SOLUTION IDENTIFIED** - Will be handled via tenant readings management page

### ❌ Issue 12: Missing Tenant Readings Management Page - NEEDS IMPLEMENTATION
- **Problem**: No page exists for reviewing, editing, and managing tenant readings
- **Impact**: Cannot review readings, edit mistakes, or handle meter replacements after saving
- **Additional Requirement**: Must include billing protection (prevent editing billed readings)
- **Status**: **NEEDS IMPLEMENTATION** (High Priority)

## Implementation Status ✅

### ✅ All Critical Issues Fixed
- **Previous Reading Logic**: Fixed query in stored procedure to correctly get last reading for property+unit using vw_TenantReading
- **Charge Code Integration**: Stored procedure now properly handles charge code integration
- **Invoice Column Handling**: Invoice columns now properly initialized as NULL
- **First-Time Reading Handling**: Added proper support for new units with no previous readings
- **Input Validation**: Enhanced validation to require current reading > 0

### ✅ Previously Completed
- Authentication UX fixes implemented
- SweetAlert implementation completed  
- Database schema update scripts created and **DEPLOYED**
- Enhanced API endpoints implemented
- Enhanced UI integration completed
- Batch QR UX and print stability improvements completed
- **Database schema updates executed** (t_tenant_reading columns added, t_tenant_reading_ext table created)
- **Stored procedure deployed** (sp_t_SaveTenantReading with all fixes)

## Next Immediate Actions
1. **Fix Location Data Capture**: Implement GPS/location data collection and storage
2. **Fix Report SQL Error**: Resolve parameter type issue in meter-reading-report.php
3. **Fix UI Population**: Ensure recent readings table displays data correctly
4. **Improve Dialog Design**: Enhance success dialog for better user experience
5. **End-to-End Testing**: Test complete QR reading flow with real data including:
   - First-time readings (new units)
   - Regular monthly readings
   - Tenant transition readings (move-in/move-out)
   - Input validation (current reading > 0)
6. **Tenant Readings Management Page**: Implement comprehensive reading management interface
   - Reading review and edit capabilities with billing protection
   - Instructions to use existing invoice void interface for billed readings
   - Export options (Excel, PDF, Print)
   - Meter replacement handling via edit interface
7. **Production Deployment**: Deploy to production environment
8. **Documentation Updates**: Update user and technical documentation
