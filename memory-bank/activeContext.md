# Active Context

## Current Focus
PLAN mode - **COMPLETED** ✅

## Current Task
**PLANNING PHASE COMPLETE**: Comprehensive planning document created with detailed implementation strategy, risk assessment, and testing plan.

## Key Requirements Identified
1. **Utility Rate Management Enhancement**
   - Single-point entry for Electric and LEAC rates
   - Automatic classification of units as residential/commercial
   - Bulk update functionality for all active tenants
   - Integration with existing charge management system

2. **Mobile QR Code Meter Reading System**
   - Web-based mobile application for meter reading
   - QR code generation and scanning capability
   - Real-time data entry and validation
   - Integration with existing tenant reading system

## Technical Context
- PHP 7.2 application layer ✅
- MSSQL 2019 database ✅
- Windows Server 2019 environment ✅
- Existing RMS framework integration required ✅

## Planning Phase Results

### Comprehensive Planning Completed
- **Requirements Analysis**: Core business and technical requirements documented
- **Component Analysis**: Database and application components identified
- **Design Decisions**: Architecture, UI/UX, and algorithm design documented
- **Implementation Strategy**: 8-12 week timeline with detailed weekly breakdown
- **Risk Assessment**: High, medium, and low risk items identified and mitigated
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit, integration, and user acceptance testing planned

### Key Planning Outcomes
1. **Two-Phase Approach**:
   - Phase 1: Utility Rate Management (Weeks 1-4)
   - Phase 2: Mobile QR Code System (Weeks 5-8)

2. **Technology Stack Defined**:
   - Backend: PHP 7.2 with existing RMS framework
   - Database: MSSQL 2019 with new tables
   - Frontend: HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript (mobile-responsive)
   - Integration: RESTful API for mobile integration

3. **Risk Mitigation Strategies**:
   - Database schema changes: Comprehensive testing and backup procedures
   - System integration: Modular development and rollback procedures
   - Mobile compatibility: Responsive design and cross-browser testing

## Next Phase Requirements

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **TECHNOLOGY VALIDATION**: Complete VAN QA mode for technical validation
2. **CREATIVE MODE**: Design decisions for UI/UX and architecture
3. **IMPLEMENTATION**: Begin Phase 1 development
4. **CONTINUOUS MONITORING**: Track progress and adjust plan as needed

### Creative Phase Requirements
- **UI/UX Design**: Interface design for rate management and mobile meter reading
- **Architecture Design**: Database schema, API design, system integration
- **Algorithm Design**: Bulk update, QR code generation, data synchronization

## Current Phase
PLAN mode - **COMPLETED** ✅
**Next**: VAN QA mode for technical validation, then CREATIVE mode for design decisions
