    - **Print Functionality**: Browser print with optimized layouts and page breaks
16. **Enhanced Reporting**: Advanced analytics and data visualization for laptop/PC browsers

## Critical Issues Status ✅

### ✅ Issue 1: Incorrect Previous Reading Calculation - FIXED
- **Problem**: Stored procedure not correctly retrieving previous reading from most recent reading for unit
- **Impact**: Previous readings saved incorrectly, affecting usage calculations
- **Status**: **FIXED** - Updated to use vw_TenantReading with consistent ORDER BY ISNULL(reading_date, convert(date, reading_date_to)) DESC for proper chronological ordering including late encoding scenarios

### ✅ Issue 2: Missing Charge Code Integration - FIXED
- **Problem**: System not creating entries in t_tenant_reading_charges for CUCF and CUCNF charge codes
- **Impact**: Charge codes not linked to readings, breaking billing workflow
- **Status**: **FIXED** - Stored procedure now properly handles charge code integration

### ✅ Issue 3: Invoice Columns Not Set to NULL - FIXED
- **Problem**: Invoice-related columns in t_tenant_reading_charges should be NULL initially
- **Impact**: May cause issues with billing workflow
- **Status**: **FIXED** - Invoice columns now properly initialized as NULL

### ✅ Issue 4: First-Time Reading Scenario - FIXED
- **Problem**: New units with no previous readings not handled properly
- **Impact**: First-time readings could fail or produce incorrect results
- **Status**: **FIXED** - Added proper handling for NULL previous readings

### ✅ Issue 5: Input Validation Enhancement - FIXED
- **Problem**: Current reading validation not strict enough (allowed 0)
- **Impact**: Invalid readings could be saved
- **Status**: **FIXED** - Updated validation to require current reading > 0

## New Issues Status ✅

### ✅ Issue 7: Location Data Not Captured - FIXED
- **Problem**: `location_data` column in `t_tenant_reading_ext` is empty
- **Impact**: Missing GPS/location information for audit trail
- **Status**: **FIXED** - Location data capture implemented

### ✅ Issue 8: Meter Reading Report SQL Error - FIXED
- **Problem**: `meter-reading-report.php` returns SQL error: "The number of rows provided for a TOP or FETCH clauses row count parameter must be an integer"
- **Impact**: Report generation fails completely
- **Status**: **FIXED** - SQL parameter type issues resolved

### ✅ Issue 9: Recent Readings UI Not Populated - FIXED
- **Problem**: Recent readings table in UI is not showing the last reading data
- **Impact**: Users cannot see their recent readings in the interface
- **Status**: **FIXED** - UI population using t_tenant_reading_ext table

### ✅ Issue 10: Success Dialog Design Issues - FIXED
- **Problem**: Success dialog box is not following best design practices for user-friendly data display
- **Impact**: Poor user experience and unclear information presentation
- **Status**: **FIXED** - Enhanced dialog design implemented

### ❌ Issue 11: Electric Meter Replacement Scenario - SOLUTION IDENTIFIED
- **Problem**: When electric meters are replaced, new meter starts at 0, making previous reading = 0
- **Impact**: Usage calculation would be incorrect (current reading - 0 = current reading as usage)
- **Status**: **SOLUTION IDENTIFIED** - Will be handled via tenant readings management page

### ❌ Issue 12: Missing Tenant Readings Management Page - NEEDS IMPLEMENTATION
- **Problem**: No page exists for reviewing, editing, and managing tenant readings
- **Impact**: Cannot review readings, edit mistakes, or handle meter replacements after saving
- **Additional Requirement**: Must include billing protection (prevent editing billed readings)
- **Status**: **NEEDS IMPLEMENTATION** (High Priority)

### 🔄 Issue 13: User Access Rights Implementation - IN PROGRESS
- **Problem**: QR Meter Reading modules need proper user access rights validation
- **Impact**: Users without proper permissions can access QR meter reading functionality
- **Status**: **IN PROGRESS** - Database setup completed
- **Requirements**:
  - ✅ **Database script executed** - Module and user group created
  - Update authentication system to check user permissions
  - Create proper access denied pages for unauthorized users
  - Add failed login messages for users without QR Meter Reading permissions
  - Integrate with existing RMS user group system (s_modules, s_user_group, s_user_group_modules)

## Implementation Status ✅

### ✅ All Critical Issues Fixed
- **Previous Reading Logic**: Fixed query in stored procedure to correctly get last reading for property+unit using vw_TenantReading
- **Charge Code Integration**: Stored procedure now properly handles charge code integration
- **Invoice Column Handling**: Invoice columns now properly initialized as NULL
- **First-Time Reading Handling**: Added proper support for new units with no previous readings
- **Input Validation**: Enhanced validation to require current reading > 0

### ✅ Previously Completed
- Authentication UX fixes implemented
- SweetAlert implementation completed  
- Database schema update scripts created and **DEPLOYED**
