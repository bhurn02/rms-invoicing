# Active Context ✅ Enhanced QR Generator - Current State

## Current Focus
Batch QR UX and print stability improvements completed; camera test removed from generator page in favor of dedicated `camera-test.html`.

## Current Task
Stabilize batch generation UX/print (done) and streamline scope by removing redundant scanner tab (done). Remaining: database configuration for live active tenants API.

## Implementation Status ✅ Updated

### ✅ Completed in this cycle
- Fixed extra blank page during Batch "Print All"
- Switched print layout to block flow with explicit page breaks only
- Ensured last page does not force trailing break; avoided inside breaks
- Made tenant table rows clickable with clear visual feedback; larger checkboxes
- Kept “Select All” logic consistent and synced with row visuals
- Removed "Test Scanner" tab and all scanner-related code from generator page
- Removed `html5-qrcode` dependency from `qr-generator.html`

### ⏳ Still Pending / Out of Scope This Cycle
- Database configuration for live tenant data (production MSSQL credentials) for `api/get-active-tenants.php`

## Notes
- Camera testing remains available via `pages/qr-meter-reading/camera-test.html`
- Batch QR UI and printing verified working after fixes
