# Active Context üöÄ **IMPLEMENT MODE - PHASE 1**

## Current Focus
**IMPLEMENT MODE** - Phase 1: Mobile QR Code Meter Reading System

## Current Task
**IMPLEMENTATION PHASE 1 STARTING**: Beginning QR Code System development with Bootstrap 5, Executive Professional styling, and standalone deployment architecture.

## Key Requirements Identified ‚úÖ **READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION**

1. **Mobile QR Code Meter Reading System (PHASE 1 - IMPLEMENTATION STARTING)**
   - **Bootstrap 5 modern interface** with Executive Professional styling
   - **Standalone deployment** in self-contained folder for IIS flexibility
   - **QR code generation and scanning** with sophisticated camera integration
   - **Progressive Web App** with offline capability and modern UX
   - **Database integration** with existing t_tenant_reading table
   - **Non-technical user focus** with intuitive, confidence-building interface

2. **Utility Rate Management Enhancement (PHASE 2 - PLANNED)**
   - Single-point entry for Electric and LEAC rates
   - Automatic classification of units as residential/commercial (existing space_type)
   - Bulk update functionality for all active tenants
   - **Bootstrap 5 enhanced interface** integration with existing RMS
   - **Executive-level dashboard** with confidence-building previews

## Technical Context ‚ö†Ô∏è **UPDATED STACK**
- **Frontend Framework**: Bootstrap 5.3+ (Latest stable) ‚úÖ
- **QR Code Library**: html5-qrcode.min.js (Camera integration) ‚úÖ
- **Progressive Web App**: Service Worker + App Manifest ‚úÖ
- **PHP 7.2 application layer** ‚úÖ
- **MSSQL 2019 database** ‚úÖ
- **Windows Server 2019 environment** ‚úÖ
- **IIS dual deployment options**: Standalone OR integrated ‚úÖ

## Planning Phase Results ‚ö†Ô∏è **MAJOR UPDATES**

### Comprehensive Planning Completed
- **Requirements Analysis**: **QR CODE SYSTEM PRIORITIZED** - easier implementation, immediate value
- **Component Analysis**: **Standalone deployment architecture** for IIS flexibility  
- **Design Decisions**: **Bootstrap 5 modern design system** with PWA capabilities
- **Implementation Strategy**: **8-12 week timeline REORDERED** - QR code first (Weeks 1-4)
- **Risk Assessment**: **Updated for new architecture** - camera compatibility, deployment scenarios
- **Testing Strategy**: **Dual deployment testing** - standalone and integrated scenarios

### Key Planning Outcomes ‚ö†Ô∏è **UPDATED**
1. **PRIORITY REORDERED**:
   - **Phase 1**: QR Code System (Weeks 1-4) - PRIORITIZED FIRST
   - **Phase 2**: Utility Rate Management (Weeks 5-8) - MOVED TO SECOND

2. **Technology Stack Upgraded**:
   - **Bootstrap 5.3+**: Modern UI framework with responsive design
   - **PWA Architecture**: Offline capability and app-like experience
   - **Standalone Deployment**: Self-contained folder structure
   - **Database Integration**: Uses existing t_tenant_reading table

3. **IIS Deployment Options**:
   - **Option 1**: Standalone IIS Application (qr-meter-reading/)
   - **Option 2**: Integrated with RMS (rms/qr-meter-reading/)
   - **Flexible Configuration**: Environment-specific settings
   - **Shared Database**: Connect to existing RMS MSSQL

## Next Phase Requirements ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMMEDIATE QR CODE FOCUS**

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **QR CODE SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT**: Begin Phase 1 implementation
2. **BOOTSTRAP 5 SETUP**: Modern UI framework environment
3. **STANDALONE ARCHITECTURE**: Self-contained project structure
4. **CREATIVE MODE**: Design decisions for Bootstrap 5 theme and QR scanner UX

### Creative Phase Requirements (PRIORITY 1 - QR CODE)
- **Bootstrap 5 Modern Theme**: Color scheme, typography, design tokens
- **QR Scanner Interface**: Camera viewfinder, scanning feedback, touch-friendly design
- **Progressive Web App Design**: App-like experience, offline functionality
- **Standalone Deployment Architecture**: Self-contained system design

## Current Phase
PLAN mode - **COMPLETED** ‚úÖ (MAJOR UPDATE - QR CODE PRIORITY, BOOTSTRAP 5, STANDALONE DEPLOYMENT)
**Next**: CREATIVE mode for Bootstrap 5 modern design and QR scanner UX design

## Key Changes from Previous Planning ‚ö†Ô∏è **MAJOR UPDATES**

### Priority Reordering
1. **QR CODE SYSTEM FIRST**: Moved to Phase 1 (easier, immediate value)
2. **UTILITY RATES SECOND**: Moved to Phase 2 (more complex, builds on QR success)

### Technology Upgrades  
1. **BOOTSTRAP 5 INTEGRATION**: Latest responsive UI framework
2. **PROGRESSIVE WEB APP**: Offline capability and modern UX
3. **STANDALONE DEPLOYMENT**: IIS deployment flexibility

### Architecture Improvements
1. **DUAL DEPLOYMENT OPTIONS**: Standalone OR integrated with RMS
2. **EXISTING DATABASE USAGE**: Leverage t_tenant_reading (no schema changes)
3. **MOBILE-FIRST DESIGN**: Touch-friendly, responsive Bootstrap 5 interface
