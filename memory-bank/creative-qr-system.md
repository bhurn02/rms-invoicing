### Bootstrap 5 + Custom Enhancement Strategy
```css
/* Custom Professional Enhancements */
.btn-scan-primary {
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, #1e40af 0%, #3b82f6 100%);
  font-size: 1.25rem; /* 20px - larger for non-technical users */
  padding: 1.25rem 2.5rem; /* Extra generous touch target */
  border-radius: 0.75rem; /* Modern rounded corners */
  box-shadow: 0 4px 14px 0 rgba(30, 64, 175, 0.2);
}

.card-professional {
  border-radius: 1rem; /* 16px - friendly but professional */
  box-shadow: 0 4px 6px -1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  padding: 2rem; /* Generous breathing room */
  border: 1px solid rgba(243, 244, 246, 0.8);
}

.feedback-success {
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, #d1fae5 0%, #a7f3d0 100%);
  border-left: 4px solid #059669;
  padding: 1.5rem;
  border-radius: 0.5rem;
  font-size: 1.125rem; /* Larger, more readable */
}
```

## CREATIVE PHASE 2: ARCHITECTURE DESIGN

### 🎨🎨🎨 ENTERING CREATIVE PHASE: ARCHITECTURE DESIGN 🎨🎨🎨

**Component Description**: Standalone QR Code Meter Reading System Architecture - Self-contained web application supporting both standalone IIS deployment and RMS integration.

**Requirements & Constraints**:
- **Deployment Flexibility**: Both standalone IIS app and RMS integration
- **Database Integration**: Connect to existing MSSQL `t_tenant_reading` table
- **Progressive Web App**: Service worker, offline capability, installable
- **PHP 7.2**: Backend compatibility with existing RMS

**Architecture Options Analyzed**:

1. **Monolithic Self-Contained Architecture**
   - Single folder with all dependencies bundled
   - Pros: Extremely simple deployment, no external dependencies
   - Cons: Larger file size, harder to update components

2. **Modular Component Architecture** ⭐ **SELECTED**
   - Separated concerns with distinct modules
   - Pros: Clean separation, easier testing, reusable components, scalable
   - Cons: More complex deployment, requires planning

3. **Hybrid Deployment Architecture**
   - Smart configuration adapting to deployment context
   - Pros: Single codebase for multiple deployments, automatic detection
   - Cons: Complex configuration logic, testing both modes

4. **Microservice PWA Architecture**
   - API-first with separate frontend/backend services
   - Pros: Modern architecture, API reusability, maximum flexibility
   - Cons: Over-engineered for current needs, higher complexity

4. **Hybrid Adaptive Algorithm**
   - Smart format selection based on data complexity
   - Pros: Optimal efficiency per use case, future-proof, backward compatible
   - Cons: Highest implementation complexity, multiple code paths

**Offline Sync Options Analyzed**:

A. **Simple Queue with Retry** ⭐ **SELECTED**
   - FIFO queue with exponential backoff retry
   - Pros: Simple, reliable, predictable behavior
   - Cons: May delay newer readings

B. **Priority-Based Sync with Conflict Resolution**
   - Smart prioritization with duplicate detection
   - Pros: Intelligent handling, prevents duplicates
   - Cons: Complex implementation, requires conflict resolution logic

**DECISIONS**: 
- **QR Format**: JSON-Based with checksum validation
- **Sync Algorithm**: Simple Queue with exponential backoff retry

**Rationale**: Achievable within 4-week timeline, provides good balance of features vs complexity, human-readable for debugging, extensible for future needs.

**Implementation Specifications**:
- QR JSON structure with version, property ID, unit number, meter ID, timestamp, checksum
- LocalStorage queue for offline readings
