- **Filter Component**: `ReadingsFilter` with date range, property, tenant filters
- **Search Component**: `GlobalSearch` with real-time search

### **Backend Architecture**
- **RESTful API Endpoints**: Consolidated CRUD operations following RESTful conventions

  - `PUT /api/readings.php?id={id}` - Update reading (with `id` parameter)
  - `DELETE /api/readings.php?id={id}` - Delete reading (with `id` parameter)
  - `POST /api/readings/batch-update.php` - Batch update multiple readings
  - `POST /api/readings/manual-entry.php` - Manually create a new reading
  - `GET /api/readings/tenants.php` - Search tenants for manual entry (renamed from tenant-search.php)
- **Validation**: Hybrid validation with client-side and server-side checks
- **Database**: Efficient queries with proper indexing using actual schema fields from ERD
- **Caching**: Smart caching for validation results
- **Audit Trail**: Complete tracking of all operations

### **Database Integration**
- **Tables**: `t_tenant_reading` and `t_tenant_reading_ext`
- **Procedures**: Stored procedures for CRUD operations
- **Validation**: Database-level validation and constraints
- **Audit**: Audit trail for all modifications
- **Performance**: Optimized queries with proper indexing

This bridge document ensures that the isolation-focused approach maintains continuity between Creative Mode and Implementation Mode for Phase 17, achieving the 98% success rate target.
