## üí° TIPS FOR TESTING

1. **Start with Critical Tests (1-15)** - These are essential
2. **Watch the browser console** (F12) for errors
3. **Test with real data** - Use actual property codes and units from your database
4. **Take screenshots** of any errors for documentation
5. **Note unexpected behavior** even if test "passes"
6. **Test on your primary browser** first (Chrome/Edge recommended)
