# Phase 17.4: Critical Bug Fix - Testing Instructions

**Date**: October 09, 2025  
**Priority**: üö® **CRITICAL**  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **FIX IMPLEMENTED - READY FOR YOUR TESTING**

---

## üéØ WHAT WAS FIXED

I've implemented a **5-layer defense system** to prevent invoiced readings from being deleted through batch operations:

### **‚úÖ Layer 1: Disabled Checkboxes**
Invoiced reading checkboxes are now **disabled** and show tooltip "Cannot select invoiced readings"

### **‚úÖ Layer 2: Row Click Warning**
Clicking invoiced reading rows shows warning dialog

### **‚úÖ Layer 3: Batch Modal Validation**
Batch operations modal shows **red alert** and **disables Execute button**

### **‚úÖ Layer 4: Execute Protection**
Final check with SweetAlert error if user somehow bypasses

### **‚úÖ Layer 5: Backend Validation**
Enhanced SQL validation on server side

---

## üß™ HOW TO TEST THE FIX

### **Test 1: Verify Disabled Checkboxes** (30 seconds)
1. Open Tenant Readings Management page
2. Find a reading with "Invoiced" status badge
3. **Expected**: Checkbox should be **grayed out/disabled**
4. **Expected**: Hovering shows tooltip "Cannot select invoiced readings"
5. **Expected**: Cannot check the checkbox

### **Test 2: Try Clicking Invoiced Row** (30 seconds)
1. Find an invoiced reading row
2. Click anywhere on the row (not on action buttons)
3. **Expected**: Warning dialog appears
4. **Expected**: Message says "Cannot Select Invoiced Reading"
5. **Expected**: Shows tenant name

### **Test 3: Batch Modal with Invoiced Selection** (1 minute)
1. Select ONLY non-invoiced readings (2-3 readings)
2. Click "Batch Operations" button
3. **Expected**: Modal opens normally, no warning
4. **Expected**: Execute button is enabled
5. Close modal
6. Now try to select an invoiced reading (should be disabled)
7. **Expected**: Checkbox doesn't check

### **Test 4: Try to Bypass (If Possible)** (1 minute)
**This test verifies backend protection**
1. If you can somehow select an invoiced reading (using browser dev tools)
2. Open batch operations modal
3. **Expected**: **RED ALERT BOX** at top of modal
4. **Expected**: Lists specific invoiced readings
5. **Expected**: Execute button is **DISABLED**
6. **Expected**: Button tooltip shows "Cannot execute: X invoiced reading(s) selected"
