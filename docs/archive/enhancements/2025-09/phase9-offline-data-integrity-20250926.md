# Archive: Phase 9 - Offline Data Integrity Fix (Cache-First Tenant Resolution)

Date: 2025-09-26
Phase: 9
Status: Completed & Archived

Summary
- Implemented cache-first tenant resolution with 4-level fallback (cache → offline history → defaults → server)
- Normalized `propertyCode` and `unitNo` across app and service to eliminate whitespace-related mismatches
- Previous reading retrieval from cache when available with network fallback
- Service Worker stabilized: correct base paths (/rms/qr-meter-reading/), split local vs CDN caching, optional file handling
- Added targeted diagnostics for cache hits/misses to speed troubleshooting

Key Changes
- pages/qr-meter-reading/assets/js/app.js
  - TenantResolutionService: internal normalization helpers; cache-first resolution fixed
  - Normalization applied in showReadingForm, submitReadingForm, getPreviousReadingData, resolveFromCache, resolveFromOfflineHistory
  - Enhanced logs for cache lookups and previous reading data resolution
- pages/qr-meter-reading/service-worker.js
  - Corrected URL base paths; resilient caching (local addAll, CDN/optional individually)
- APIs
  - Confirmed shared config usage; get-tenant-data.php used for server fallback

Validation
- Tenant resolution uses Strategy 1 (cache) reliably
- Previous reading found in cache; network fallback operational
- Service Worker installs/activates without cache errors
- Minor warning: Placeholder manifest icons should be replaced with real PNGs
